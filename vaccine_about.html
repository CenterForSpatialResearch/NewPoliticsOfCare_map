<div id="aboutText"><p>Mapping the New Politics of Care: Inequality and Vaccine Redistribution Within Phase 1a</p>

<p>All people in the United States have been granted the right to have access to free, safe, and effective COVID-19 vaccines. But due to the limited doses available, states have enacted policies prioritizing specific groups based on reasonable—but subjective—weighing of scientific, practical, and ethical evidence and values.</p>

<p>The goal of this map is to examine how prioritizing different groups for vaccination shifts the terrain of vaccine allocation and impacts which communities are protected first.</p>
</div>


<div class="aboutTitle"> Background: Covid-19 Vaccine Distribution and Allocation in The United States</div>
 <div class="answer">
<p>The federal government, through Operation Warp Speed, is responsible for purchasing and distributing COVID-19 vaccines to states (and other jurisdictions and agencies). As supplies are limited, the federal government is distributing vaccines to states in direct proportion to their adult population. While there is no binding rule on how states (and other jurisdictions and agencies) should allocate limited vaccines, so far the majority of states have followed the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC’s) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) COVID-19 Vaccines Work Group recommendations. </p>

<p>ACIP’s vaccine prioritization recommendations are made with the following goals: 
Decrease death and serious disease as much as possible
Preserve functioning of society
Reduce the extra burden COVID-19 is having on people already facing disparities, ,  </p>
<p>ACIP determined that in Phase 1a, the first groups to be prioritized should consist of health-care personnel and long-term care facility residents. In its guidance, ACIP was explicit in citing evidence that prioritizing Phase 1a groups would mitigate health inequities due to “the disproportionate representation of racial and ethnic minority groups” among low-wage health-care personnel and that the lowest-rated long-term care facilities “are more likely to serve patients experiencing social or economic disadvantage and are more likely to have COVID-19-associated outbreaks.” 
</p>
<p>

<i>It is in the spirit of ACIP’s efforts to mitigate health inequities that we set parameters for our map.</i>
</p>
<p>
Based on the prioritization recommendation of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Committee on Equitable Allocation of Vaccine for the Novel Coronavirus, we have used the CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) to identify areas as vulnerable.
</p>
</div>

<div class="aboutTitle"> Mapping Priorities</div>


 <div class="answer">
   <p>
The map enables the comparison of four COVID-19 vaccine allocation scenarios at the county level.
</p>
<p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Adult population</strong><br>
An extension of the federal government’s vaccine distribution rationale from the state level to the county level
</li>
<li><strong>Phase 1a</strong><br>
ACIP’s prioritization of health-care personnel and long-term care facility residents
</li>
<li><strong>Phase 1a weighted by SVI (incl. race/ethnicity)</strong><br>
Suballocation within Phase 1a by CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index 
</li>
<li><strong>Phase 1a weighted by SVI (excl. race/ethnicity)</strong><br>
Suballocation within Phase 1a by CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index (excl. race/ethnicity)
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>

These comparisons highlight the trade-offs of competing strategies: between each pair of maps, you will see the respective number of vaccine doses allocated to each county and therefore which populations and communities are protected first. 
</p>
<p>

As we switch between the various allocation methods, the number of doses allocated will vary by county but the total number of vaccines distributed to the state will remain the same.
</p>
</div>


<div class="aboutTitle">Case Study: Comparing Allocations in Prince George’s County, Maryland</div>

 <div class="answer">
<p>

As of January 26, Maryland has been allocated 657,500 first doses, or enough to cover ~14.1% of  its estimated adult population of 4,677,166. 
</p>
<p>

<i>Adult Population</i><br>
Prince George’s County is Maryland’s second most populous county with an estimated adult population of 705,633 (~15.1% of the state’s adult population). Therefore when allocating doses by the adult population, Prince George’s is allocated 99,195 doses (~15.1% of the state’s total allocation of 657,500 doses).
</p>
<p>

<i>Phase 1a</i><br>
If instead we were to allocate doses to Prince George’s County based on their proportion of the state’s Phase 1a population (~14.5%) then the county would be allotted 95,172 doses. Compared to an allocation by the adult population, this decrease of 4,022 doses (-4.1%) is due to the county’s lower proportion of adults to Phase 1a population.
</p>
<p>

<i>Phase 1a weighted by SVI </i><br>
Allocating by Phase 1a weighted by SVI, Prince George’s County would be allotted 114,011 doses. Compared to allocating by just Phase 1a, weighting Phase 1a by SVI increases the allotment of doses by 18,839 (19.8%) due to the county’s larger proportion of Phase 1a population weighted by SVI then Phase 1a population alone.
</p>
<p>

<i>Phase 1a weighted by SVI vs Phase 1a weighted by SVI (excl. race/ethnicity)</i><br>
But if the SVI race and/or ethnicity factor is excluded from the Phase 1a weighting by SVI, then Prince George’s County would be allotted 97,275 doses. Compared to Phase 1a weighted by SVI, excluding the race and or ethnicity factor decreases doses by 16,736 (-14.7%) due to Prince George County’s larger proportion of non-white non-hispanic people—and puts it more in line with the allocation under Phase 1a alone of 95,172 doses.
</p>
</div>


<div class="aboutTitle">Trade-offs</div>

 <div class="answer">
<p>

As the map shows, no scenario is neutral. Each prioritization reflects an explicit or implicit valuation, as well as the logistical challenges of distributing vaccine doses to hundreds of millions of Americans as quickly as possible. This project visualizes the differences and trade-offs between each of these choices in the hopes that a more nuanced understanding of the options will lead to more informed and ethical outcomes.
</p>
<p>

Indeed, even if we do not base dose allocations on prepandemic vulnerability directly, understanding who is likely to be left behind might enable states to make targeted investments in outreach, distribution facilities, and health-care capacity in order to mitigate the impact of existing inequality.
</p>
<p>
However, data from state health departments already show that vaccinations among Black Americans trail their white counterparts—even in the above population groups. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="aboutTitle">Estimation Methods</div>


 <div class="answer">
<p>
<div class="aboutSubtitle">Adult population</div>
The number of vaccine doses for each county is allocated based on the number of actual doses distributed to the state and in proportion to the estimated adult population of each county.
<br>
<img src="equations/adult_pop.png" width="500px">
</p>

<p>
<div class="aboutSubtitle">Phase 1a </div>
The number of vaccine doses for each county is allocated in proportion to the estimated number of health-care personnel and residents of long-term care facilities.
<br>
<img src="equations/phase1a.png" width="540px">
</p>

<p>
<div class="aboutSubtitle">Phase 1a weighted by SVI (incl. race/ethnicity)</div>
County Phase 1a estimates are weighted by the county’s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) ranking, an unweighted average of the population percentages of SVI’s 15 social factors.
<br>
<img src="equations/svi.png" width="650px">
</p>

<p>
<div class="aboutSubtitle">Phase 1a weighted by SVI (excl. race/ethnicity)</div>
The calculation is similar to Phase 1a weighted by SVI (incl. race/ethnicity), except that here SVI is composed of only 14 social factors as the race/ethnicity variable (i.e., “Minority Status”) is excluded. 
<br>
<img src="equations/sviMinus.png" width="720px">
</p>
</div>

<div class="aboutTitle">Data</div>

 <div class="answer">
<p>
Vaccine distribution data are from the CDC’s COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution Allocations by Jurisdiction for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
</p>
<p>
Adult population estimates are from the American Community Survey 5-Year Data (2015–2019) .
</p>
<p>
Health-care personnel estimates are from the 2018 Census Business Patterns (CBP), defined by Healthcare and Social Assistance Sector (NAICS 62) excluding Social Assistance (NAICS 624).
</p>
<p>
Long-term care facility (LTCF) residents estimates are from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Provider Information dataset for nursing homes including rehab services.
</p>
<p>
SVI rankings were estimated by applying the most recent SVI methodology to the American Community Survey 5-Year Data (2015–2019).
