The enrollment criteria share some factors with SVI*, such as income, household composition, disability, and employment status.",
          "Unemployment_capita":"As the pandemic has rolled through the United States, unemployment has increased dramatically; this increase is a sign of the economic toll the virus has taken. For many workers in America, health care access is tied to a job. With rising unemployment, many have been left uninsured or underinsured.",
          "SVI": "SVI* calls attention to counties with the greatest number of its highly vulnerable per-capita factors across the four areas of socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, minority status and language, and housing type.",
          "YPLL":"Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL) represents community-specific health vulnerability in the United States by measuring rates of premature death. Some of the counties that have the stateâ€™s highest values for SVI* also have the highest levels of YPLL. But other counties are newly visible as vulnerable.",
            "Covid":"The direct effects of COVID-19 have exacerbated many of the preexisting vulnerabilities in the United States. Sometimes long-term vulnerabilities and the impact of COVID-19 coincide in our maps, but sometimes they do not.",
          "Covid_capita":"Normalizing recent COVID-19 cases by population highlights the less populous counties where large proportions of a community have acquired the virus",
        "Covid_death_capita":"Cumulative COVID-19 deaths normalized by population show places that have had a severe epidemic at any time since March 2020, whether those deaths were recent or occurred months ago."
